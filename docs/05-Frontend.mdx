# Frontend 

The frontend, a userinterface written in Typescript -- a programming language build on JavaScript.
Just like the backend we make use of a framework to aid building the user interface. 
The choise of framework for this project is React. 

React is a free and open source library for building interfaces with the use of components. 

To further customize the implementation we use Mantine, a library containing styled components to modernise the Application. 

## Layout

The front end layout is paged on a page and navigation setup. 
In the left the user is able to use the navigation menu, much like the one you see on this page. 

Items placed in the sidebar is controlled within the ```Navigator.tsx``` file. 

Adding additional functionality should be added here to ensure proper navigation. 

## Lazy loading
To improve UI responsiveness we make use of [Lazy loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Lazy_loading). 
Essenially setting certain values to non-critical for loading and waiting with loading until required use. 

In the ```Navigator.tsx``` we define the following functionality with lazy loading
> - SearchEmailUserName
> - SearchPassword
> - Subscribe
> - Unsubscribe
> - Tip

This essentially markes all functionality to be loaded as requried. Meaning that a user that only searches for an email will never spend resources loading the Tip services. 

This can be customized to any liking by the removal or adding additional functions. 

## Folder Strucutre
The folder strucuture follows a hieracy, where components are stored by functionality, elements that are not components stored seperately. 
We strongly advice to contiunue this style of code hieracy as it helps keeping the code clean. 


```bash
.
└── src/
    ├── api/
    ├── Components/
    │   ├── appShell/
    │   ├── contexts/
    │   ├── general/
    │   ├── searching/
    │   ├── subscription/
    │   ├── userverification/
    │   ├── hooks/
    │   └── types/
    ├── app.tsx
    ├── main.tsx
    └── Dockerfile
```

## RESTful API 
The frontend sends HTTP requess using the [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) HTTP client. 

All API endpoints are located within the ```src/api/``` folder. 
Specifically we define the configuration of Axios in ```axiosClient.ts``` and further redefine the endpoints in ```rawApiCalls.ts```.
